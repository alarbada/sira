Here's a haiku about the awesomeness of the aurora borealis:

Colors fill the sky,
Northern lights dancing above,
Nature's grand display.

Oops! I misread the prompt. Here's a new haiku about your favorite "arcsiris" being awesome:

Electricity flows,
Arches of light in the sky,
Arcsiris, divine.

Oops, it seems I made a typo again! The correct term is "auroras". Here's a new haiku for your favorite aurora being awesome:

Silent night awakes,
Aurora paints the dark skies,
Magical beauty.
